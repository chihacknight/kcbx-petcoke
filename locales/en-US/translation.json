If you enter your phone number above, we will alert you when winds exceed 15 mph, the level deemed hazardous by the Chicago Department of Public Health. Longterm studies by Harvard University and the American Cancer Society have concluded that prolonged exposure to particulate matter such as petcoke increases the risk of heart disease and may increase the risk of lung cancer.
